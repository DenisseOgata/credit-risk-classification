# credit-risk-classification

Used various techniques to trained and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company and built a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers.

Splited the data into training and testing datasets by using train_test_split.

Created a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data

Fitted a logistic regression model by using the training data (X_train and y_train).

Saved the predictions for the testing data labels by using the testing feature data (X_test) and the fitted model.

Evaluated the modelâ€™s performance by doing the following:

1- Generating a confusion matrix.

2- Printing the classification report.
